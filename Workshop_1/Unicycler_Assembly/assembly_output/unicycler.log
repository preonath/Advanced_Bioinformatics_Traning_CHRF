----------------------------------------
    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since you provided only short reads, Unicycler will essentially function as a SPAdes-optimiser. It will try many k-mer sizes, choose the best based on contig length and graph connectivity, and scaffold the graph using SPAdes repeat resolution.
